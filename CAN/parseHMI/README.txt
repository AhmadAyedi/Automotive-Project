in this case the implementation of requirements is not my job 
i will just get a ready to use txt file containing all the signals 
my role is to read directly those signals from the txt file that the HMI team
provided me with 

Requirements is not my concern in this case
after reading parsing sending and triggering my slave will send back signals 
to master as response in txt file so that HMI team get it and process it 
accordingly and display on their interface
